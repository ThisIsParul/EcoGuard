## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ThisIsParul/EcoGuard.git
cd EcoGuard

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

### Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run deforestation_main.py
```

Then open the link provided in your terminal to view the app in your browser.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is provided as `dataset.csv`. Ensure it is present in the root directory. You can customize the path in `dataset_path.py`.

---

## 🛠️ Model

The model used for deforestation detection is stored as `deforestation_model.joblib`, generated by `model_creation.py`.

To retrain or update the model:

```bash
python model_creation.py
```

---

## ✅ Requirements
